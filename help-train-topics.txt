  The filename in which to write unnormalized weights for every topic and word type.  By default this is null, indicating that no file will be written.
  Default is null
--word-topic-counts-file FILENAME
  The filename in which to write a sparse representation of topic-word assignments.  By default this is null, indicating that no file will be written.
  Default is null
--diagnostics-file FILENAME
  The filename in which to write measures of topic quality, in XML format.  By default this is null, indicating that no file will be written.
  Default is null
--xml-topic-report FILENAME
  The filename in which to write the top words for each topic and any Dirichlet parameters in XML format.  By default this is null, indicating that no file will be written.
  Default is null
--xml-topic-phrase-report FILENAME
  The filename in which to write the top words and phrases for each topic and any Dirichlet parameters in XML format.  By default this is null, indicating that no file will be written.
  Default is null
--output-topic-docs FILENAME
  The filename in which to write the most prominent documents for each topic, at the end of the iterations.  By default this is null, indicating that no file will be written.
  Default is null
--num-top-docs INTEGER
  When writing topic documents with --output-topic-docs, report this number of top documents.
  Default is 100
--output-doc-topics FILENAME
  The filename in which to write the topic proportions per document, at the end of the iterations.  By default this is null, indicating that no file will be written.
  Default is null
--doc-topics-threshold DECIMAL
  When writing topic proportions per document with --output-doc-topics, do not print topics with proportions less than this threshold value.
  Default is 0.0
--doc-topics-max INTEGER
  When writing topic proportions per document with --output-doc-topics, do not print more than INTEGER number of topics.  A negative value indicates that all topics should be printed.
  Default is -1
--num-topics INTEGER
  The number of topics to fit.
  Default is 10
--num-threads INTEGER
  The number of threads for parallel training.
  Default is 1
--num-iterations INTEGER
  The number of iterations of Gibbs sampling.
  Default is 1000
--num-icm-iterations INTEGER
  The number of iterations of iterated conditional modes (topic maximization).
  Default is 0
--no-inference true|false
  Do not perform inference, just load a saved model and create a report. Equivalent to --num-iterations 0.
  Default is false
--random-seed INTEGER
  The random seed for the Gibbs sampler.  Default is 0, which will use the clock.
  Default is 0
--optimize-interval INTEGER
